#prompt the user to enter 2 numbers and output the sum of the two numbers

#Algorithm

#inputs//

#1. ask the user for the first numbers
number1 =  int(input("Enter the first value: "))
#Convert string number into an integer

#2. ask the user for the second number
number2 = int(input("Enter the second value: "))
#Convert string number into an integer

#process data//

#3. calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum_of_numbers = number1 + number2
#output
#4. print the answer to the user
#"The answer to x + y = sum"
print(f"The answer to {number1} + {number2} is {sum_of_numbers}")
